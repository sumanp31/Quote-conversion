# Quote-conversion

When it comes to loans, we often visit banks to know what the privileges are we can get, and similar banks also check whether we are capable of repaying the loan. Banks often give us quotation of the price to be paid, in instalments. Similarly, they also want to know the conversion rate of a customer, if they would choose to avail the loan or not. Machine learning can be employed is a useful tool which can help banks identify with the help of certain factors if a customer will avail the loan if given a quotation.
